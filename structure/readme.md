# Structure

#### This file describes new modular structure of Applied Energistics 3 and repartition of AE2's items, blocks and other features between modules.

It is important to note that this file is repartition of **AE2's features only**. Applied Energistics 3 will have new systems, new mechanics and a lot of new stuff, but these are not included in here, as these will be discussed later on, because we have to move over the old stuff first.
_Also, not all old stuff made it over ;) :(_

## [Modules](modules.md)

Applied Energistics 3 is split into modules. Each module represents a certain theme/feature/element/...
For more, go to the [modules docs page](modules.md).

#### Current Modules Structure:
**(All modules under _Core_ are internal)**

- Core
  - Crafting
  - ME
  - Spatial
  - World Gen
- Debug (not distributed)
- Decorative
- Miscellaneous
- Tools
